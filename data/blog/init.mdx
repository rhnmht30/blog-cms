At last, after months of utter procrastination, I am more than ready to launch my blogging website! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

Since the start of 2020, I had a simple idea replaying in my mind about creating my blog. It excited me far too much that I started thinking about it, not as a writer but as a developer.

I somewhat focused on the websiteâ€™s design and functionalities than on the content that I wanted in my blog. Because of this, I did what most of us are guilty of doing, before starting a side project, that is, buying a domain. And, the rest is history.

## Why am I Starting a Blog in 2021?

As the world went upside down, I too, became a madman. Being a senior-year college student, I had little time, owing to college course work and internships. I became less attentive to my blogging.

Back when I had begun teaching myself programming, almost two years ago, I always depended on people in the developer community. They would share their experiences through blogs and videos, backing me to learn a great deal, without a CS degree. Starting a blog is the reason I want to give back to the community. I want to spread my gained-insight so that people after me have an ample of perspectives to check out from.

## What Inspires Me and Why I think I am ready?

Over the years, I have read an awful lot of blogs. I enjoy reading when I am weary of coding, when I am stuck on a bug, or whenever I crave to pick up something new. I have come across folks who have an engaging writing style and a natural way of explaining things.

To mention a few, I sought wisdom from [Tania Rascia](https://taniarascia.com/), [Josh Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/), [Lee Robinson](https://leerob.io/), [Catalins Pit](https://catalins.tech/), and [Shad Mirza](https://iamshadmirza.com/). And I can go on forever. Since the list is non-exhaustive, consider this curated record of trending blogs by [Monica Lent](https://bloggingfordevs.com/).

As an avid reader, I have grasped a handful of pointers, which would support me to create my engrossing content. My first real blogging experience was when I had to [write about a hackathon](https://medium.com/dsckiet/mlh-local-hack-day-2019-hack-status-200-how-we-organized-our-first-hackathon-from-scratch-29deb4c203f9). My club had organised it from scratch. Writing about something I had eager feelings for made me realise just how thrilling it all is.

However, [my club](https://dsckiet.com/) always occupied hours in some project or activity, preventing me from fixing space for blogs and website. Yet, I persuaded my juniors to write on matters they were getting a hang on. And lending a hand in proofreading their blogs nurtured my motivation.

Despite everything, I have developed plenty of ideas about blogging topics. Subscribe, to stay in the loop! ðŸ˜„

## My Initial Strategy

As of now, I do not have a decent social media following.
I depend on my friends (and fine people such as you) to share my work. But to grow
my blog, I will follow some steps shown below to raise traction:

-   **Cross-posting to [dev.to](https://dev.to/rhnmht30) and [Hashnode](https://rhnmht30.hashnode.dev/)**, for they have the largest community of readers and writers.
-   **Running a [mailing list](/newsletter)** to keep people up-to-date
-   **Submitting blogs on aggressive platforms** like Reddit, Hacker News, etc. (though I would have to be extra careful there ðŸ˜…)

Now, donâ€™t take this the wrong way. I am indifferent to followers and views. This is just to keep my enthusiasm up. My prime focus is to create quality, extensively researched content.

## Conclusion

If you made it this far, thank you for reading my first blog! This shows that if I can start one, then you can too. And you hear this from a person who took eight months to set his blog in motion. So, never give up, because it gets better.

Presuming that you want to know about how I built this blog from the ground up, have a look at my next post [here](/blog/i-over-engineered-my-blog).

2021, here I come!
